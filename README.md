# Introduction

PAMI means PHP Asterisk Manager Interface. As its name suggests its just a
set of php classes that will let you issue commands to an ami and/or receive
events, using an observer-listener pattern.

The idea behind this, is to easily implement operator consoles, monitors, etc.
either via SOA or ajax.

A port for nodejs is available at: http://marcelog.github.com/Nami
A port for erlang is available at: https://github.com/marcelog/erlami

# Abandoned?

As the origin appears to be abandoned, I have forked it and added some things
that I need.

# PHP Versions

Note: PAMI Requires PHP 8.0+

# Installing
Add this library to your [Composer](https://packagist.org/) configuration. In
composer.json:
